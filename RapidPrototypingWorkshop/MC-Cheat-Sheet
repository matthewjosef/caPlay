-why it matters.

Set tone of fun and creativity.
Break down hierarchy by communicating in an informal, playful, and authentic way.
Assess needs throughout the event and modify approach as needed -- be careful to balance guidance with brevity. Giving them space will give them license to be creative.

"A workshop like this is interesting in that it can help you get an idea of what it would be like to work with someone.  Do they dive right in?  Hold back?  Dominate the conversation? Listen well? Make themselves scarce when "low status" tasks need doing?

ex: “Making allows us to be authors and creators. Even (and maybe especially) when its collaborative there is something powerful about changing the world in a physical way. Taking something from an idea to something you can touch and feel. There’s something special about having an idea and then using your hands to turn that into something in the physical world. Most of us don’t get to do that very often in our day jobs.”

MC Personal Story [2 minutes]

Telling them your story: Impresses them, connects them to you, and gives them license to treat you like an authority as well as a peer.

“Humble brag” about yourself and introduce your co-workers by name indicating who they are.  Be vulnerable.  Tell them something about the pain that you've experienced in your life and how that has left you compelled to follow the path that you are on.

Explain why we've designed this Rapid Prototyping Workshop the way we have. [3 minutes]

Introduction to Chain Reaction [5 minutes]

Building a chain reaction machine: Like a Rube Goldberg machine it’s a super complicated, funny, creative machine contrived to perform a simple task.
What does that mean? It’s like dominoes, yes, but also balloons, funnels, marbles, etc.

"The goal is open ended, flat out, cut-your-ear-off creativity, not the machine working."

ex: “We used to give a prize for the “raddest section” that freakin’ worked. We figured out that was boring. Now we give a prize to the weirdest, craziest, funny, creative machine.”

"We have power tools on the left, and sexy junk on the right. As you can tell from the selection of sexy junk, we have a set of expert curators, relentlessly combing the finest of 99 cent stores to find material for your event. Apparently, they are extremely fond of dominoes, popsicle sticks and googly eyes."

No instruction and you can build more or less anything you can think up.

Time Boxes:

1 hour for first build;5 minutes to set up for the first run.
45 minutes for second build; 5 minutes to set up for the final run.
Prizes:
Straightline prize to the least creative contraption after the first run.
“The Rube” prize to the most creative after the final run.
Encourage them to:
Use vertical space, gravity, levers, pulleys, slingshots,
When I yell go, you’re going to use the bin wall [point to], the tool table [point to], and your brains [point to your head] to build the most creative, complicated, funny chain reaction possible.
“Ready? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO!”

Award Straightline Prize [5 minutes]
Try to pick a team whose personality will “wear it with dignity” and it won’t hurt their confidence as much as egg them to do better.
Two Hints
Teams that do best are the ones that jump right in and start working.
Two seemingly paradoxical tips: (1) Have Fun; (2) Fail Fast
Failing fast helps you get comfortable with failure.
Lots of tiny fails helps prevent strategic/catastrophic failure
Fun is the perfect coping mechanism for failure.

Announce 14 min, 4 min and 1 min warnings
Start a whisper campaign that you will be doing team interviews.

Setup and Final Run [5 minutes]

Announce 14 min, 4 min and 1 min warnings
Start a whisper campaign that you will be doing team interviews.
Do interviews, starting by asking their team name, from the last team through the first team.

Award “the Rube” Prize [5 minutes]

Teachable Moment
Make it 30 seconds or less.
Something like:

Failing Fast is hard. Mostly because of the failure part. I’m not great at it. Constantly focused on perfection – for example, this is my first time leading this event. Hopefully I didn’t FAIL – but I had to be aware that was a possibility—and be okay with it. That allows you to gain from failure.
At caLabs, we rephrase that concept a bit:
If you constrain the size of risks, you enable people to take many more risks, and to learn and grow as a consequence.

Gratitude & Goodbye [5 minutes]

We hope you had a great time. I know we definitely did. 
Gratitude, shaking hands, kissing babies.
