Chain Reaction Design Tips
The name of the game here is complexity. The purpose of a Rube Goldberg machine is to seriously over-engineer a process in order to perform a simple task. Make your section as intricate -- and as interesting -- as you can.

GRAVITY
Gravity serves as a very useful resource that can help you “store” energy throughout your chain reaction.

TRANSFER
A variety of mechanisms can be used to transfer energy.

MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE
Simple machines can serve to gain a mechanical advantage in a transfer of energy.
