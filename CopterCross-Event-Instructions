Event Instructions

Set Up
-Maybe hand out laser pointers (with tripod, or weighted bases) that point straight up.  Giving teams a target to hit (or fly around) during skill building exercises (the light beam column).  Could even have tied to string or something so that they are spaced apart the right amount.  

Five laser pointers per team.  Four Red. One Blue or Green.

Could put in two patterns:

1) a straight line, evenly spaced apart -- to help pilots build skills with judging distance for stopping, reaching a point, etc.  Can start with them 3 feet apart, and as pilots get better, move them closer and closer to together -- until they are finally 6 inches apart and the pilot is trying to hit the third light column, but not the fourth.

2) an X pattern, with Red on the ends of the X and Blue/Green in the middle of the X.

3) Green / Blue at Origin and Red columns surrounding "target zone" (That allows the target zone to be larger than just the size of the quad copter)

Guest Arrival


Welcome

- First Rule of CopterCross: Breath.
- Second Rule of CopterCross: Be Gentle and Slow.. 
- Third Rule of CopterCross: Throttle down if you lose control

1) Partner Up
   Instructions for how Pilot/Co-Pilot teams work together:
   Co-Pilot reads instructions and acts as a second set of eyes.
   Pilot flies Copter.

   Find a buddy team!
   These are your go-to people for questions, problems etc.  Also, they will be the first team that you compete against during your skill builder exercizes.
   Plus, during the main event, they are going to be your partners in the relay race.

2) Safety
   blades are sharp!
   rotor guards
   picking up a copter
      1) communication with pilot 
        P: Good to Grab!
        CP: Grabbing! 
      2) how to pick up a Copter without hurting it or yourself

3) Batteries (and battery maintenance)
   Include Battery Practice
   + Battery cheat sheet
   cheat sheet should include voice commands (a la rock climbing) such as:
   *Charging!*
   *Green Bag*
   *Red Bag*

   as well as instructions for "batteries that have been used (at all) go in the red bag" and "Fully charged batteries go in the green bag"

4) Language!
     Fun Drills for pilot/co-pilot communication
     Flash cards?
     Design a game?
     Map words to motion?
     Map words to controls?
     Map controls to motion?
yaw-	rotating right or left
pitch- forward and backward
roll-	right and left
uplift- fly up
downfall- fly down

5) Be the Copter
       Pilot / Co-Pilot practice
       builds intuitive understanding of copter movements
       reinforces language lessons

6) Crawling
    Rotating on the ground, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    Forward, then back to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    Backward, then back to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    Right, then back to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    Left, then back to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.

11) Nose-In Walking Forward and Backward (Hard)
   Face nose towards pilot. 
      Right will be left. Backwards will be forwards
      Like balancing a stick. Whatever direction quad goes, stick goes
   
   Take off, 
      hover at 3 feet.
    Fly forward 5 feet.
    hover.
    fly backward to origin.
    hover.
    land.

    Take off, 
    hover at 3 feet.
    Fly left 5 feet.
    hover.

13) Walking with Scissors: Banking
   Start going forward, about 5 mph
   Apply small amount of aileron.
   Continuously pull up on elevator
   Continuously apply yaw. 

14) Walking with Scissors: Figure 8's

15) Walking with Scissors: Flips

16) Fly by Screen
    Pilot / Co-Pilot collaboration
