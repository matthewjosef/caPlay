GUEST ARRIVAL

Welcome
Intro to the Team

Introduction to Collaborative Advantage
  Our company focuses on empowering individuals and fostering collaboration in order to help our clients -- and the organizations that they are a part of -- to thrive.  

  Our work ranges from 
  -- engaging events like this one 
  -- to working with senior enterprise leaders to bring about organizational and cultural change 
  -- to building protocols and applications that help communities self-regulate more effectively.

  That last bit is the most abstract, but the goal can be summed up quite simply:
  We believe that world doesn't currently have a functional global regulatory system.  Attempts to use traditional forms of "Big G" Government to solve our most complicated issues have proven ineffective.

  Small groups have always "regulated" themselves a little differently.  Instead of laws and courts and prisons and all that, they use informal social norms and individual decisions about who to turn toward and who to turn away from.  These reputation based systems have had difficulty working in group sizes in the thousands, millions or billions, but we believe that information technology can change that.

  We work -- alongside many others -- to build the tools that can enable peer-to-peer regulation to become the basis for a functional global regulatory system, in part because it doesn't force us to "agree about what is appropriate."  We are working to design and build these systems in ways that balance privacy and transparency with our focus on building "self-regulating" structures that mimic the patterns that have proven themselves in natural ecosystems.

  That's all a mouth-full.  But I hope it gives you a sense of who we are, and why our work takes the form that it does.

  In everything we do, we aim to be playful, thoughtful and fearless and we hope that you'll embrace that spirit as you tackle today's challenge: flying Remote Control QuadCopters.

****************************************************************************************

****************************************************************************************
FACILITATOR MANUAL

  Pick up your QuadCopter.
  Is anything missing?

  Yep.  The Rotors.  We need to put them on.
  You should have 8 rotors on your side of your table: four with stripes and four without.  This gives you spares in case you crash and damage or lose rotor blades.  If you need extras, we have more up front.


  BE CAREFUL PUTTING ON ROTORS.
  Half of the motors spin one way, and half spin the other way.
  We need to match blades to motors.
  Some blades spin clockwise.  We've put a stripe on those.
  We've also put a stripe on arms that have a clockwise spinning motor.

  Take two with stripes and put those on the two arms of the copter that have stripes.
  You can put them on by lining up the metal pin on top of the moter with the hole in the bottom of the rotor.

  REMOVING ROTORS
  Use the Rotor Tool (it looks like a tiny crowbar) to remove a rotor.
  (demonstrate rotor removal)

  Each of you should practice by removing a couple of rotors and putting them back on.

  Keep the Rotor Tool near your battery charging station so it is easy to find.


****************************************************************************************

****************************************************************************************
FLIGHT MANUAL
2) EQUIPMENT
   ROTORS

   !!!  ALWAYS UNPLUG THE BATTERY OR PUT THE TRANSMITTER DOWN BEFORE ATTACHING OR REMOVING ROTORS  !!!


   ATTACHING ROTORS
   1. Put a blade with a stripe onto an arm with a stripe.
   2. Now do the same for the other arm with a stripe.
   3. Attach two blank blades to the two blank arms.


   REMOVING ROTORS
   Use the Rotor Removal tool to help pry a rotor off.  It is like a tiny crowbar.
   Be careful not to damage the rotor or the motor pin.

  BATTERIES
   Batteries only last for 5-7 minutes of flight time.
   You will have to change batteries repeatedly during this exercise.

   Use the Battery Changing Cheat Sheet each time.

   1) Pilot, Turn Transmitter OFF, then say "TRANSMITTER OFF"

   2) DETACHING a battery from the QuadCopter
      [ ] Breath!

      [ ] Be gentle!  If you are too rough here, you can strip the connector off of the 
          electrical wires, thus breaking the quadcopter and disqualifying your team from the race.
      
      [ ]  Pinch on the edges of the connection and carefully pull the connection apart.

   3) Place used battery on Charger. Make sure that the RED charging light turns on.  If the charger has no room for the battery (or if the event ends before batteries are fully charged), place the un(der)-charged batteries in the RED BAG.

   4) Move any extra FULLY CHARGED batteries from the CHARGER to the GREEN BAG.

   5) Take one FULLY CHARGED battery out of the green bag for use in the QuadCopter.

   6) CONNECTING a battery to the QuadCopter
      [ ]   Breathe!

      [ ]   Be gentle.   If you are too rough here, you can bend the pins on the connection,  
            thus breaking the quad copter, and disqualify your team from the race.
 
      [ ]   Align the connections and carefully press them together.

3) SAFETY THIRD!
   
   FIRE
   Our Copters use LI-PO (Lithium Polymer) batteries.  These batteries have high power relative to their weight, but are more volatile than normal batteries.

   The chances are slim, but it is possible for them to catch fire while charging or as a result of a crash.

   If there is a fire -- 
   1) DO NOT PUT WATER ON THE FIRE!

   2) Yell "FIRE!"

   3) Our staff will use a Chemical Fire Extinguisher to put out the fire.

6) Calibrate the Transmitter
   (you should only need to do this once)
   We are going to set the Transmitter to Mode 2.
   1) P: Hold both sticks to the upper left (if this were a compass, they would point NorthWest)
   {NEED IMAGE OF STICKS POINTING NW}
   2) P: Turn Power On (by moving the ON/OFF switch up)
   3) P: Rotate both sticks around in a clockwise circle, two times.
   4) P: Let the sticks go (they should be centered)
   5) P: Hold down any TRIM button for 2 seconds.
   6) Transmitter will read "System Initializ"

7) Pre-Flight Inspection
    [ ]   P:  "Transmitter Off"
    [ ]   CP: "Arms Check" 
    [ ]   CP: "Rotors Check" (no broken parts, hair etc)
    [ ]   CP: "Rotor Guard Check" (if guard is blocking a prop, bend it out to unblock)
    [ ]   CP: "Ready to Fly"

9) Trim Adjustment
   - Power Throttle slightly
   - Observe any drift in the copter
   - Use the Trim Buttons to adjust:
        - Yaw (adjusts rotation)
        - Pitch (adjust front/back drift)
        - Roll (adjusts sideways drift)

SKILL BUILDERS

We are going to do a series of skill building exercises that will build up your QuadCopter Skillset step-by-step.



****************************************************************************************

****************************************************************************************
FLIGHT MANUAL

SKILL BUILDERS

For each skill builder:
Work as a Pilot/Co-Pilot team.
Co-Pilot guides Pilot through the route with verbal commands.
Pilot flies the copter.
Run through each step.
Repeat route 2 more times.
Then, switch Pilot/Co-Pilot and repeat the exercise.
After, we will hold a quick head-to-head challenge with your buddy team.

10) SKILL BUILDER: Crawling
    
    One of our principles for innovation and mastery is:
    Constrain the size of risks so you become free to take risks.

    In that spirit, we are going to start out by practicing new skills by piloting the copter without leaving the ground.

    Remember, Co-Pilot guides Pilot through the exercize with verbal commands. 
    Repeat the route three times
    Then switch Pilot/Co-Pilot and Repeat

    You have 8 minutes to each complete three practice runs.
    Then we will do a buddy team challenge.

FACILITATOR MANUAL

So far, we've been flying in straight lines.  It's time to change that.

Banking involves using YAW, in combination with PITCHING (and/or ROLLING) to allow you to fly a curved path.
It is really useful for flying around things at speed.

We're going to start out on the ground to learn the motions.

    3 Parts to banking:
      1) HOLD ELEVATOR UP
      2) APPLY SOME THROTTLE
      3) YAW LEFT OR RIGHT TO BANK

   Spend a minute getting a feel for this, then we'll run another Skill Builder.
