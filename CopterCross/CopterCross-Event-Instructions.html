Event Instructions

Set Up
-Maybe hand out laser pointers (with tripod, or weighted bases) that point straight up.  Giving teams a target to hit (or fly around) during skill building exercises (the light beam column).  Could even have tied to string or something so that they are spaced apart the right amount.  

Five laser pointers per team.  Four Red. One Blue or Green.

Could put in two patterns:

1) a straight line, evenly spaced apart -- to help pilots build skills with judging distance for stopping, reaching a point, etc.  Can start with them 3 feet apart, and as pilots get better, move them closer and closer to together -- until they are finally 6 inches apart and the pilot is trying to hit the third light column, but not the fourth.

2) an X pattern, with Red on the ends of the X and Blue/Green in the middle of the X.

3) Green / Blue at Origin and Red columns surrounding "target zone" (That allows the target zone to be larger than just the size of the quad copter)

Guest Arrival


Welcome

- First Rule of CopterCross: Breath.
- Second Rule of CopterCross: Be Gentle and Slow. 
- Third Rule of CopterCross: Throttle down if you lose control

1) Partner Up
   Instructions for how Pilot/Co-Pilot teams work together:
   Co-Pilot reads instructions and acts as a second set of eyes.
   Pilot flies Copter.
   Each person will take turns playing both roles.

   Find a buddy team!
   These are your go-to people for questions, problems etc.  
   They will also be the first team that you compete against during your skill builder exercizes.
   Plus, during the main event, they are going to be your partners in the relay race.

   You will compete against them.  Then you will compete with them.

2) INTRO TO THE EQUIPMENT

   QUADCOPTER
   (need a diagram. copy from instructions)

   1) Body
   2) Arms
   3) Motors
   4) Rotors
   5) Rotor Guard
   6) QC Power Cable
   7) Battery and Battery Cable

   CONTROLLER
   (need a diagram. copy from instructions)

   1) On/Off switch
   2) Elevator 
   3) Throttle
   4) Elevator Trim
   5) Throttle Trim
   6) Screen 
   etc.

3) SAFETY THIRD!

   BLADES 
   At these speeds, blades are sharp!
   
   Do not fly near other people.  
   Do not try to pick up copter while blades are spinning.  
   Do not try to catch copter in the air.  
   Rotor guards help minimize the likelihood of injury

          How to pick up a Copter without hurting it or yourself
          a) Pilot (P): Move elevator to the down position, then say: 
                    ["ELEVATOR DOWN"]
          
          b) P: Set down the controller, then say: 
                    ["CONTROLLER DOWN"]
          
          c) P: Take hands off controller, then say:
                    ["GOOD TO GRAB"]

          d) Co-Pilot (CP): Say 
                    ["GRABBING!]"

          e) CP: Grab QuadCopter BY THE BODY. 
                                       Not by the arms. 
                                       Not by the rotors.

   BATTERIES
   Batteries only last for 5-7 minutes of flight time.
   You will have to change batteries repeatedly during this exercise.

   Use the Battery Changing Cheat Sheet each time.

   1) Turn Controller OFF

   2) DETACHING a battery from the QuadCopter
      A) Breath!
      B) Be gentle.  If you are too rough here, you can strip the connector off of the electrical wires, thus breaking the quadcopter and disqualifying your team from the race.
      C)  Pinch on the edges of the connection and carefully pull the connection apart.

   3) Place used battery on Charger. Make sure that the RED charging light turns on.  If the charger has no room for the battery (or if the event ends before batteries are fully charged), place the un(der)-charged batteries in the RED BAG.

   4) Move any extra FULLY CHARGED batteries from the CHARGER to the GREEN BAG.

   5) Take one FULLY CHARGED battery out of the green bag for use in the QuadCopter.

   6) CONNECTING a battery to the QuadCopter
      1) Breathe!
      2) Be gentle.   If you are too rough here, you can bend the pins on the connection, thus breaking the quad copter, and disqualify your team from the race.

   BATTERY CHEAT SHEET
   ( ) P: Controller OFF ["CONTROLLER OFF"]
   ( ) CP: Gently DETACH Battery cable ["DETACHED"]
   ( ) CP: Gently Remove Battery
   ( ) CP: Place Battery on Charger (or in RED BAG) ["CHARGING"]
   ( ) CP: Extra Charged Batteries go in GREEN BAG.
   ( ) P: Gently CONNECT New Battery to Copter
   ( ) P: Place Battery in Copter
   ( ) P: Twist and Tuck Cable Attachment ["BATTERY READY"]     

4) Language!
     Fun Drills for pilot/co-pilot communication

     Design a game?
     Map words to motion?
     Map words to controls?
     Map controls to motion?

       Pilot / Co-Pilot practice
       builds intuitive understanding of copter movements
       reinforces language lessons

6) Calibrate the Transmitter
   (you should only need to do this once)
   We are going to set the Transmitter to Mode 2.
   1) P: Hold both sticks to the upper left (if this were a compass, they would point NorthWest)
   2) P: Turn Power On (by moving the ON/OFF switch up)
   3) P: Rotate both sticks around in a clockwise circle, two times.
   4) P: Let the sticks go (they should be centered)
   5) P: Hold down any TRIM button for 2 seconds.
   6) Transmitter will read "System Initializ"

7) Pre-Flight Inspection
   - CP: Rotor Blades Check (no broken parts, hair etc)
   - CP: Rotor Guard Check (if guard is blocking a prop, bend it out to unblock)

8) Powering On and Connecting
   - P:  Turn on Transmitter (will read "Bind to Plane")
   - P:  Throttle Down
   - CP: Attach Copter Battery.
   - CP: Secure B nz  - P: say "Ready to Fly"


9) Trim Adjustment
   - Power Throttle slightly
   - Observe any drift in the copter
   - Use the Trim Buttons to adjust:
        - Yaw 
        - Pitch
        - Roll
 {NEED IMAGE OF TRIM BUTTONS}

10) Crawling
    
    Yaw Right on the ground, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    
    Yaw Left on the ground, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    
    
    Pitch Forward, then Pitch Backward to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    
    Pitch Backward, then Pitch Forward to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.

    
    Roll Right, then Roll Left to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
    
    Roll Left, then Roll Right to origin, without leaving the ground. Repeat 3 Times.
