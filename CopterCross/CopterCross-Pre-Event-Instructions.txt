Laser Pointer Idea
Set Up
-Maybe hand out laser pointers (with tripod, or weighted bases) that point straight up.  Giving teams a target to hit (or fly around) during skill building exercises (the light beam column).  Could even have tied to string or something so that they are spaced apart the right amount.  

Five laser pointers per team.  Four Red. One Blue or Green.

Could put in two patterns:

1) a straight line, evenly spaced apart -- to help pilots build skills with judging distance for stopping, reaching a point, etc.  Can start with them 3 feet apart, and as pilots get better, move them closer and closer to together -- until they are finally 6 inches apart and the pilot is trying to hit the third light column, but not the fourth.

2) an X pattern, with Red on the ends of the X and Blue/Green in the middle of the X.

3) Green / Blue at Origin and Red columns surrounding "target zone" (That allows the target zone to be larger than just the size of the quad copter)
