GUEST ARRIVAL
Welcome

- First Rule of CopterCross: Breath.
- Second Rule of CopterCross: Be Gentle and Slow. 
- Third Rule of CopterCross: THROTTLE DOWN if you lose control!

1) Partner Up
   Instructions for how Pilot/Co-Pilot teams work together:
   1) Co-Pilot reads instructions and acts as a second set of eyes.
   2) Pilot flies Copter.
   Each person will take turns playing both roles.

   Find a buddy team!
   These are your go-to people for questions, problems etc.  
   They will also be the first team that you compete against during your skill builder exercizes.
   Plus, during the main event, they are going to be your partners in the relay race.

   You will compete against them.  Then you will compete with them.

2) INTRO TO THE EQUIPMENT

   ASSEMBLY: ROTOR GUARDS AND ROTORS

   PUTTING ON THE ROTOR GUARD
   With the rotors off of the QuadCopter, 

   PUTTING ON ROTORS
   Half of the motors spin one way, and half spin the other way.
   We need to match blades to motors.
   Some blades spin clockwise.  We've put one dot on those.
   We've also put a dot on arms that have a clockwise spinning motor.
   Put a blade with a dot on an arm with a dot.

   Other blades spin counter clockwise, we've left those blank.
   Put a blank blade on a blank arm.

   REMOVING A ROTOR
   Use the Rotor Removal tool to help pry a rotor off.  It is like a tiny crowbar.
   Be careful not to damage the rotor.


3) SAFETY THIRD!
   BLADES 
   At these speeds, blades are sharp!

   Do not fly copter close to other people.  
   Do not try to pick up copter while blades are spinning.  
   Do not try to catch copter in the air.  
   Rotor guards help minimize the likelihood of injury

          How to pick up a Copter without hurting it or yourself
          a) Pilot (P): Move throttle to the down position, then say: 
                    ["THROTTLE DOWN"]
          
          b) P: Set down the transmitter, then say: 
                    ["TRANSMITTER DOWN"]
          
          c) P: Take hands off transmitter, then say:
                    ["GOOD TO GRAB"]

          d) Co-Pilot (CP): Say 
                    ["GRABBING!]"

          e) CP: Grab QuadCopter BY THE BODY. 
                                       Not by the arms. 
                                       Not by the rotors.

   BATTERIES
   Batteries only last for 5-7 minutes of flight time.
   You will have to change batteries repeatedly during this exercise.

   Use the Battery Changing Cheat Sheet each time.

   1) Turn Transmitter OFF

   2) DETACHING a battery from the QuadCopter
      A) Breath!
      B) Be gentle.  If you are too rough here, you can strip the connector off of the electrical wires, thus breaking the quadcopter and disqualifying your team from the race.
      C)  Pinch on the edges of the connection and carefully pull the connection apart.

   3) Place used battery on Charger. Make sure that the RED charging light turns on.  If the charger has no room for the battery (or if the event ends before batteries are fully charged), place the un(der)-charged batteries in the RED BAG.

   4) Move any extra FULLY CHARGED batteries from the CHARGER to the GREEN BAG.

   5) Take one FULLY CHARGED battery out of the green bag for use in the QuadCopter.

   6) CONNECTING a battery to the QuadCopter
      1) Breathe!
      2) Be gentle.   If you are too rough here, you can bend the pins on the connection, thus breaking the quad copter, and disqualify your team from the race.

   BATTERY CHEAT SHEET
   ( ) P: Controller OFF ["TRANSMITTER OFF"]
   ( ) CP: Gently DETACH Battery cable ["DETACHED"]
   ( ) CP: Gently Remove Battery
   ( ) CP: Connect Battery to Charger (or in RED BAG) ["CHARGING"]
   ( ) CP: Extra Charged Batteries go in GREEN BAG.
   ( ) P: Throttle Stick DOWN
   ( ) P: Power ON Controller
   ( ) P: Gently CONNECT New Battery to Copter
   ( ) P: Place Battery in Copter
   ( ) P: Twist and Tuck Cable Attachment ["BATTERY READY"]
   ( ) P: Pairing: Beep, Red Light turns Green, 6 Copter lights lit steadily

   We are going to set the Transmitter to Mode 2.
   1) P: Hold both sticks to the upper left (if this were a compass, they would point NorthWest)
   {NEED IMAGE OF STICKS POINTING NW}
   2) P: Turn Power On (by moving the ON/OFF switch up)
   3) P: Rotate both sticks around in a clockwise circle, two times.
   4) P: Let the sticks go (they should be centered)
   5) P: Hold down any TRIM button for 2 seconds.
   6) Transmitter will read "System Initializ"
